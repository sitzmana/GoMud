# Modules

Extract any modules into this folder.

* Modules should be named uniquely, in a manner that identifies their purpose.
* Modules should be inside of a subfolder of `modules`, named after their package.
  * Example: `modules/birds/` would contain the `birds` module/package.

* Module folders should container a `datafiles` folder that contains any datafiles needed.
  * Files within `datafiles` will be treated as though located within the actual `_datafiles`
  * These files are read-only.

## Things Modules can do:

* Access core GoMud code.
* Listen for, handle and/or cancel events (See `modules/auctions`)
  * For example, run custom code every `NewRound{}` event, or do something whenever a `LevelUp{}` event is fired.
* Handle Telnet IAC commands (See `modules/gmcp`)
* Add a handler for new connections (See `modules/gmcp`)
* Add web pages to default web site (See `modules/leaderboards`)
